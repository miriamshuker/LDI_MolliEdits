June: To my humble abode.
Eddy: Oh...!
Eddy: It's so...
Eddy: Purple.
Eddy: But it's cute!
June: I'm still setting up my shelf.
June: Believe it or not, this is cleaned up.
Eddy: Um... that's kind of easy to believe, compared to my room.

Eddy: I.... no.
June: What?
Eddy: I really wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.
Eddy: My face was heating up from just standing outside, thinking about it.
June: ...Eddy.
Eddy: And I had three whole days.... Even after I promised you.
Eddy: We... don't need to do anything.
June: Eddy.
Eddy: Yeah?
June: I'll tell you straight.
June: I'm kind of upset with you.
Eddy: That's... totally fair.
Eddy: I'm sorry.
June: I <i>really</i> wanted to....
June: Aghhh.
Eddy: Same.
June: You should have told me!
June: Then we could've planned something.
June: ...
June: Think a plastic glove will work?
Eddy: ...No.
Eddy: But I'm flattered you'd try that.
June: Hm.... really though. Why didn't you say anything?
Eddy: I don't know.
Eddy: It's kinda hard for me to... say what's worrying me.
Eddy: I'd rather just not... think about it.
Eddy: That way, it's a little less real.
June: ....,
June: I won't judge how you deal with your feelings.
June: I mean, I have a tough time with a lot of things. And I don't always make healthy decisions.
June: Still. I can't. do anything if you don't tell me.
Eddy: ...I'll try.
Eddy: Ugh, I'm sorry. This should've been such a small thing, and now it's a mess.
June: No....
June: Small things matter too.
Eddy: You're right....
Eddy: You do matter.
June: I am NOT that short.
June: I have an easy joke here, but that's beneath me.
Eddy: Hmm. That's not many things.
June: You could have been.
Eddy: I-I... w-whoa, whoa.
Eddy: ...Yeah.
June: Oh! I don't want to push you either.
June: Um, tell me what you're comfortable with, and we'll work our way up.
June: I just... want to understand you better.
June: That's why I....
Eddy: .....
Eddy: Thanks.
June: Thank you for coming. I do appreciate it.
Eddy: ...
Eddy: Do you still want to watch that new episode?
June: Oh yeah! There's two, actually.
Eddy: I want to talk about it with you. And listen!
June: Me too.

Eddy: C-Carefully, I guess.
Eddy: I... read a bunch of tutorials online.
June: Um, not sure how I feel about that.
June: But I appreciate the effort!
June: Do you want to try, maybe...?
Eddy: Oh sure!

June: Maybe I can also....
Eddy: ...Oh!
Eddy: How did you think of that?
June: I just saw your reaction and figured it might work.
June: It's just like making music, remember?
June: I'm a great listener.
Eddy: That's true.
Eddy: Give me a shot too!
