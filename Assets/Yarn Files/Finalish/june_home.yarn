    Wow.
    <<cameraswap Cameras>>
    <<wait 0.1>>
    This place is HUGE!
    <<cameraswap Cameras>>
    Considering urban real estate prices, this must've cost a fortune.
    Hmm....
    Since the front door's a no-go, I should really take a look around to find an entry point.

    June: Hi.
    Eddy: Hi.
    June: ...
    June: Come on, you're not weirded out by this at all?
    Eddy: I live with Ellen.
    June: That's true.
    June: Anyway - just wanted to check on you to make sure you're alright.
    June: I mean, it's the least I could do! Since you're sneaking in and all.
    June: You do the heisting - and I'm gonna be your Q, hehe.
    Eddy: ...Ah! I get it - James Bond?
    June: ...?
    June: Star Trek.
    Eddy: Ah.
    Eddy: Nerd!
    June: How uncultured....
    June: Coming from the nerd emoji?
    Eddy: Hey -- just because you're right doesn't mean you should say it!
    Eddy: We can watch another episode when I come over. I'm still pretty behind.
    June: On like, a 30-year-old show? For shame.
    June: But okay!
    Eddy: Thanks for coming out. I'll do my best to make it worth the trouble!
    June: I should probably get back inside before my brother notices I snuck out.
    June: Before we go thoughhh....
    ->Give her a peck
        *I give her a peck on the cheek.
        June: Hmm, I guess that'll do for now.
        June: I'll get a liiittle more out of you later, you hear?
        Eddy: Planning on it!
    ->Save it for later
        *I boop her on the nose.
        June: Awww, what?
        Eddy: I want to save it for later!
        June: Hmm, alright....
    June: See you later!
    Eddy: See you!

    Well that happened.

    I still need to scout out an infiltration route though.
    Let's take a look around.

    There's no turning back now. It's heist time!

        Since I didn't find an infiltration route earlier, let's do it now.

        I already found a way in. It's around the other side, by that big tree.

Looks pretty secure here.

Seems pretty secure here, too.

No way I'm gonna go in through the front door. I'll 1000% be spotted on camera.

It's a (bronze?) statue of two adults.
The plaque reads "Employees of the Century Award".
...Aren't June's parents the owners of their nail supply company?

It's a big tree.
Looking closely, seems like I might be able to climb it....

    The window's locked.
    Or... is it??
    It seems a bit loose.
    Oh! It opens up. This seems like my way in.
    I'll let June know so she can get it fixed later.
    It's a little dangerous to leave it like this, after all!

    This is the way in! Good find. Let's regroup later to sneak in.
