Eddy: Wait, so...
Eddy: Where's your violin?
June: ...
June: ...Uh, I think I left it in the car.
Eddy: Is your dad still outside?
June: I'll be right back!
Eddy: Want me to walk you?
June: Mmm, I'm not sure if you want to meet my dad....
Eddy: I will eventually!
Eddy: But I can wait inside.
June: Thanks!

Eddy: I know how that feels.

Eddy: Ever played in a small ensemble before?
June: No, just orchestral music....
Eddy: I haven't either! But I've played accompaniment on piano before.
Eddy: Like, I'm playing the chords and stuff while someone else plays the main part.
June: This is kinda hard.
Eddy: Yeah, I'm pretty nervous too. I'm still not used to performing in front of people.
June: Even me?
June: Look, my hands are all sweaty!
Eddy: I'm fumbling like, every other note....
June: Well, what helped during accompaniment?
Eddy: Uh....
Eddy: It's really about listening to each other, I think.
Eddy: You signal when you want to start, and then you keep an ear open to any changes.
Eddy: So if they start to go a little slower, I listen and try to follow.
Eddy: And if they get too loud, we can look at each other to confirm where we should be.
Eddy: It's all about reading each others' cues and trying to complement each other.
June: Sort of like a head chef and sous chef?
Eddy: ...Maybe?
June: Let's practice some more then!
June: Really wanna get this piece down....
Eddy: Sure.
Eddy: That's what makes good music!
