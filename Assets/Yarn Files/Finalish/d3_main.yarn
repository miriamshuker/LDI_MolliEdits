Dawn of the Final Day.
...Is what I'm thinking.
But it's not dawn.
And it's not over!
No morning text today.
No Ellens to awaken me from sleep either.
<<unhide Phone>>
All that's left is to get ready and do what I can!

Eddy: Where's Mom?
Dad: She's working late today.
Ellen: Aw, again?
Dad: It's just us and the leftovers.
Eddy: Hey, these are pretty good leftovers.

....
It's 10 PM.
I've been biding my chance for this moment...!
My parents should be cozy in bed --
Mom is probably snuggled up reading a book. And Dad...
...is probably asleep.
They do wake up early, so I can't blame them for sleeping early and/or staying up to enjoy the night.
That's what I do, after all.
Here's my chance.

Sounds like Ellen's still in her room....
Good. Goooooood.
Let's hope she doesn't come out to bother me.

It's pretty quiet, but I think I can make out a bit of music.
Is Mom listening to music while she reads?

    Ellen: Hey.

    Eddy: AGH!!
    Eddy: I mean, 'ah,' what're you... doing here, dear sister?
    Ellen: Heading somewhere?
    Eddy: Um, the fridge.
    Eddy: Starving.
    Ellen: Mm hmm. I overheard you talking to June yesterday.
    Ellen: Sneaking out?
    Eddy: I --
    Eddy: Well, I am....
    Ellen: Don't worry, I get it.
    Ellen: We all want to sneak around sometimes.
    Ellen: I mean, I'm not allowed to go out and have fun two days in a row...
    Ellen: ...and I'm older than you.
    Eddy: Much older.
    Ellen: Anyway!
    Ellen: ...You should go.
    Eddy: Wait, really?
    Ellen: Yeah.
    Ellen: A favor for a favor.
    Eddy: I did you a favor...?
    Ellen: ...You get a pass this time.
    Ellen: Anyway, you should head out.
    Ellen: If anyone checks in your room, I'll just be, y'know, taking a nap.
    Ellen: Under the covers.
    Ellen: Might not even know you're missing.
    Eddy: ....
    Eddy: Thanks.

    Ellen: Smell ya later.
    Eddy: But I showered....

Sometimes the most unexpected option is the obvious one.
I can use our spare key to lock it behind me.
Sneak out the front door?
->Yes
    <<to TransitionCanvas JuneOutside>>
->No
    Maybe I have a better option....
