Eddy: Actually, it's the afternoon.
Eddy: I woke up late.

Eddy: The best thing to do in the "morning" is to collect your thoughts, in a quiet, peaceful place.

Eddy: Just gotta keep in mind my main objectives....
Eddy: First, I need to evade Mom's wrath -- 
Eddy: That means finishing my homework and chores in time, and coming home before curfew at 5 o'clock.
Eddy: Second, I need to prep for June and I's --
<<clockset UICanvas 8:52>>
Eddy: Uh, "June and mine"...?
Eddy: <i>Our</i> "heist" --
Eddy: That means scouting a path through security, getting er, protection, and most importantly...
Eddy: ...making sure she's happy!
Eddy: I should also keep <b>texting</b> people in mind.
Eddy: I can make more time for conversation if I finish things early!
<<clockset UICanvas 8:54>>
Eddy: Anyway.
Eddy: I bet as soon as I get busy, time will feel like it's flying by.
<<clockset UICanvas 8:55>>

    Let's see.... the power button doesn't work, even if held down.
    Ellen: I already tried that!

->Check AV cables <<if $tvcable is false>>
    Hm. Seems like the cables are all in the right place, so the display should show an image.
    Ellen: I tried that too!
    <<set $tvcable to true>>

    Eddy: Oh, wait. I know what it is.
    Eddy: The plug is kinda loose. Just need to push it back in there, and....
    Eddy: Got it.
    Ellen: Whaaaat!? I tried that a million times!
    Eddy: Then it worked the million-and-first time.
