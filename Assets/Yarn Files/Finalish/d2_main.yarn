June's parents picked her up, so she's on her way home.
I'm really glad I got to see her!
Being able to play together is great.
Laughing together... making her laugh....
I kinda want to do that every day.
...
Now that she's gone though, it's really dawning on me.
//this comparison returns true even if you didn't do chores.
<<if $tasks > 2>>
    This is a weird feeling.
    I've gotten so much... <i>more</i> done.
    I don't feel like I'm drowning.
    I can sleep!
    Well, if I stay on track, anyway.
    Good work, me.
<<else>>
    I still have a lot to do.
    Could've been so much further if I had just pushed a little harder....
    Why am I like this?
    How do I keep --
    No -- no.
    Anyway.
    Sunday --
    Sunday.
    1 more to go.
    Let's call it a night.
