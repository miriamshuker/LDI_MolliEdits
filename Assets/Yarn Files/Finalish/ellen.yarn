    Eddy: I mean, are you feeling okay?

Ellen: Shush!
<size=30>Eddy: Oh, right.</size>
Eddy: I thought you were happy, free, and single, after all that...?
Ellen: I was. But then I was like --
Ellen: You know what? I can do whatever.
Ellen: In fact... I've seen a couple different people already.
Eddy: Whoa. Whoaaa.
Eddy: Okay, okay.... No judgment.
Ellen: This time though?
Ellen: The guy was like, super creepy. Ultra creepy.
Eddy: Uegh. Did he do anything weird?
Ellen: I'm fine. But I feel like I want to talk about it with someone.
<<sfx alarm>>
Ellen: Oh.
Ellen: I might tell you more tomorrow. After I sleep.
Eddy: Yeah, seems like you're in a rush.
Eddy: Considering you skipped brushing your teeth and all.
Ellen: Hey!! I brushed!
Eddy: Could've fooled me.
Ellen: Get outta here.
Eddy: Night.
Ellen: Night.
Ellen: Oh! One more thing --
<<if $d0_argue is true>>
    Ellen: For your sake, you should just stop talking back to Mom. Doesn't matter if you're right or wrong.
    Eddy: I was just trying to explain!
    Ellen: Come onnn, might as well be the same thing.
<<else>>
    Ellen: Were you going to say something earlier, too?
    Eddy: I wanted to tell Mom to stop negging me.
    Eddy: It's like, I get your point, but that extra stuff isn't any help.
<<endif>>
Ellen: You have a point, but like, you gotta choose your battles.
Ellen: Knowing when to stay quiet is part of being an adult too, you know.
Eddy: I guess....
Ellen: Anyway. Night.
