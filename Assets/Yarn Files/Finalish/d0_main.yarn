June: Hey, you done with dinner?
Just finished the rest of our bun bo hue
June: Damn, that sounds good
June: You got any extra?
Nope, but I can sneak you some shrimp chips
Or durian wafers
June: Durian-flavored stuff stinks
Isn't that the point? XD
June: No, I mean it's far inferior to the real thing lol
June: Oh, that reminds me!
Hm?
June: My grandma's coming over this Sunday, so we're going for dim sum:A type of Chinese cuisine served in the form of many small plates, including dunplings, buns, fried squid, and pig's feet.
June: The thing is though
June: I have an essay due on Monday, so I can't go
Aw man
Maybe I should go in your place? ;)
June: Nahh, if my parents knew you were my bf and not just a friend you'd get yeeted out of there
My parents know about you though
June: I know. I wanna tell them too, but I'm scared about how they'd react
June: And my entire family would be bombarding me with gossip ugh
June: But nice try
Worth a shot
June: Anyway
June: Just finished my essay early
Good job!! That's early for you
June: Hey, shush
June: The thing is, my parents still think I have work to do
June: WHICH MEANS
You're gonna be home alone?
June: Yep
Are you sure you feel safe? I mean, your backdoor just got busted in last month
June: Ngl, still pretty shook about it. 
June: Like, we weren't in the house when it happened but thinking about it still gives me the creeps
June: We're getting new security installed tomorrow, at least, so I do feel safer
That's good! 
June: Actually, a bit bad in one sense
that being...?
June: Like I said, I'll be home alone
June: WHICH MEANS
We can hang out?
June: Exactly ;3
June: You should come over
Did you want to, you know...?
June: YES, it's been like 2 months since we last had privacy
June: 2 months of suffering
Jeez, I didn't think I did *that* bad
Joking, I lasted like 10 seconds...
June: That's pretty normal for the first time I think
June: I still want to try again though
Yeah, I want to make it up to you
Did some research on using my other parts and appendages
June: Ooh that sounds nice
June: I think...?
Gonna put my feet to good use XD
June: .....
Okay, but being serious. Let me know what you like and don't like
And especially if it hurts or anything
June: Sure!!!
June: Same for you
That is, assuming I somehow get in
Oh, to your house, that is
I do have a LOT to do
June: school?
School and chores stuff, yeah
But I'll catch up!!
June: Don't stretch yourself too much
June: We only have 2 days
June: And it's at like 8 PM on Sunday
Sounds like a plan
June: Wait, really!?
Yeah, I'll figure something out
Mission accepted
June: WAHOOOOO
June: that was kinda cringe
June: But I'm really excited. I'll help out however I can
So it's a official, then!
June: Let's do it?
let's do it!
