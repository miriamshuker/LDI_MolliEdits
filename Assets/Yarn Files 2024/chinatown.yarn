<<if $vchinatown is false>>
    Our local Chinatown. I love this place, as unsavory as it can sometimes seem.
    Let's look for a discreet store I can buy condoms from. I can take a look around at the same time.

    Guy: Hey, what's up?
    Eddy: Not much. Just dropping by the store.
    Guy: You seem a little tense, man. Find some time to relax.
    Eddy: Thanks, I will. After it's over, that is!
    Guy: Alright. I'll be waiting for stoplight here, in the meantime.
    Eddy: It sure is a slow light.
    Guy: You can say that again.
<<else>>
    Guy: Whoa! I saw you jumping around that building, man.
    Guy: You've got serious hops, doing parkour like that.
    Eddy: Thanks.

Eddy: Oh, hey. Do I know you from somewhere?
Guy: You go to piano lessons?
Eddy: I do, actually! Just had a recital last week.
Guy: Then that's where I'm from.

Girl 1: My nails look gorgeous!
Girl 2: But mine look better.
Girl 1: Why don't we ask Jackie, then. She can decide!
Girl 2: Jackie did my nails too, actually.
Girl 2: Isn't she great?
Eddy: Huh. Jackie is my mom's English name. She'd love this story.

Guy: What am I doing here, you're wondering?
Eddy: I was.
Guy: Waiting for my friend to show up.
Guy: We wanted to snag some bubble tea together, but it's too packed for me to wait inside.
Eddy: How long have you been waiting?
Guy: Dunno. Two days or so?
Eddy: .....

    Girl: 'Scuse me, but do you know when they're going to move these boxes?
    Girl: They've been here all day, blocking the street.
    Eddy: Sorry, I have no idea.
    Girl: Okay.
    Girl: Then could you help me take a selfie?
    ->Yes
        Eddy: Sure.
        Eddy: Just... in front of these boxes?
        Girl: Yep. They look great, and I'll be sad once they're gone.
        Eddy: Huh. So that's what you meant.
        <<set $selfie to true>>
    ->No
        Eddy: I'm really sorry, but I'm in a rush.
        Girl: Eh, no problem.

        Girl: Ah, hopefully they don't take away these boxes soon.
        Girl: They just add so much style to this boring street, y'know.
        Eddy: You might be right.

title: kantohouse

A prototypical Chinese restaurant. It's small, but pretty busy.
My dad used to work here as a chef. He moved locations when I started high school though.
Their food isn't as good as his.
===
title: nails
---
A local nail salon.
Mom works here. I hear she's in high-demand.
The supplies they use are some brand name I can't remember.
All I know is that June's parents manage that nail supply brand! Crazy, right?
My mom and hers even have the same first name. What a small world.
===
title: tea
---
A bubble tea shop. I'm not much for boba myself - sacrilegious, I know - but Ellen goes all the time.
One of my cousins works here, I think. She's probably their go-to for the kpop playlist they use in the shop.
I should come by with June sometime.

It's graffiti of some kind of demonic produce. Probably the kind that'd make you all stretchy.
I'm always amazed at where graffiti artists can go for their art.

Ah, this is a logo from one of my favorite games.
Whoever put this outside their window has great taste.
Or... maybe bad taste, because they left it outside.

Agh, I'm actually so nervous my hands are shaking.
C'mon, man. Let's go, let's go!
I've never gotten condoms before.
It feels like I'm gonna be stared at even though I know nobody cares.
What if someone sees me...? Will I get a nod of disapproval?
Someone might even tell my parents, considering how close-knit our neighborhood is.
Everyone knows each other.
Okay, deep breaths. Deep breaths.
Let's just go in.

Okay.
I got them.
I'm alive.
The cashier looked at me a little weird.
But that's probably just my imagination.
It... actually wasn't that bad?
I feel relieved I worked up the courage to come here, anyway.
I'd prefer if I didn't feel pressured into doing this in secret, but... yeah.
...Is that...?
<<cameraswap Cameras>>
<<camerashake Cameras 0.3 0.3 350>>
IT'S MY AUNT!!!
Why is she here!? And with her son, too!!
<<cameraswap Cameras>>
I can't go that way or she'll see me for sure....
Gotta find a way around her or I'm toast.
If anybody else sees me, she might notice too, so let's avoid EVERYONE.
