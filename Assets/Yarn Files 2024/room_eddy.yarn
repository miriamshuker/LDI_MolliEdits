Ah, my shelf. Gotta say, I'm pretty proud of this.&happy
Want to check something out?&normal
->Top shelf
    <<setboxlocation DialogueCanvas center>>
    Which items?
    ->Awards
        On the left, a perfect attendance certificate from middle school.
        On the right, a 4th place trophy from my elementary school chess club.&away
        ...
    ->Photo
        An old photo our parents took of me and Ellen.
        People say we look around the same age, but I'm still in high school and she's already a quarter to 100!&psh
->Middle shelves
    Which items?
    ->Figurines
        A couple anime figures I've collected over the years.
        They're really expensive, so I'm happy to have gotten them as gifts.
        Their source material is pretty mainstream, so it shouldn't be too hard to recognize them.
    ->Books
        A physics textbook, Six of Crows, some Michio Kaku books from back in my science-phase, and the first 10 volumes of Hunter x Hunter.
        The rest of our collection is in Ellen's room.
->Bottom shelves
    Which items?
    ->Bear
        A sock plushie June made me for Valentine's Day.
        I think it's supposed to be a raccoon...&uh
        ...But it's really cute!&happy
    ->Box
        A box of KINEX pieces. I think an old sock ended up in there somehow.
        If you're wondering where I keep my clothes, they're in the closet on the opposite wall.
        ...Wait, who am I talking to?&shock

I should find somewhere to collect my thoughts first.
Maybe somewhere I can freshen up.

    My trusty bed.
    Actually, I have trouble sleeping in it, but it's comfortable nonetheless.

    It's a bunk bed for some reason.
    We used to store stuffed animals up there!
