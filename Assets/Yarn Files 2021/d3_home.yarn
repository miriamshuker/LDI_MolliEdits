Mom: And where do you think you're going?
<<if $d3_ellen is true>>
    Ellen: Sorry, Eddy....
<<endif>>
Eddy: ...!
Eddy: I... I was....
Mom: Sneaking out of the house, and for a <i>girl</i>?
<< camerashake Cameras 1 0.1 50 >> 
Mom: Completely irresponsible.
Mom: You don't even know how to TALK to a girl, and you're out running behind our backs?
Eddy: T-That one's true, but --
Mom; You aren't going out any more.
Mom: Do not see her again.
Eddy: No!
Eddy: No! Why!?
Eddy: I just -- I just wanted to spend time with her.
Mom: That girl's awful. Making you dance for her, huh?
Eddy: What?
Eddy: I-I don't even know why you're so upset!
Mom; Scampering around, lying to us -- lying to ME.
Mom: I raised you, you know that?
Mom: I ask you, tell you, remind you what to do because I've seen it first.
Mom: And still you don't listen. You don't listen to me.
Eddy: What does that have to do with this!?
<< camerashake Cameras 1 0.1 50 >> 
Eddy: Do you really think I WANT to talk to you!?
Eddy: .....
Eddy: Are you really surprised I wanted to see her, by myself?
Eddy: What? Am I supposed to ask first? About something private?
Eddy: You do so much for me. I know that! I know already!
Eddy: But....
Eddy: How am I supposed to confide in you?
Mom: I'm not going to do this.
Mom: Go to your room.
<< camerashake Cameras 1 0.1 50 >> 
Eddy: No. I need to talk.
Eddy: Like... I wish I didn't feel like I need to sneak around.
Eddy: But everything I do wrong is the most important thing.
Eddy: I don't want to talk to you about that.
Eddy: I don't want to share how I'm feeling when you think you know how I <i>should</i> feel.
Mom: This is why I tell you you're too young to date. Kids your age are always thinking with their other head!
Eddy: We both wanted to --
Mom: And just like with that guy Ellen dated, it's disrespecting our family, and our rules, and telling you to do things you shouldn't.
Eddy: There were problems for sure,but  you rag on them so much.
Eddy: It's no wonder I didn't want to tell you we were dating!
Eddy: Just... picking apart everything he said and did.
Eddy: It's no wonder I didn't want to tell you we were dating!
Eddy: Comparing this and that. Not smart enough, not rich enough, not good enough.
<< camerashake Cameras 1 0.1 50 >> 
Eddy: <b>I</b> don't even know if I'm good enough!
Eddy: Why would I think you'd treat her any different!?
Mom: .....
Mom: I'm going to talk to that girl's parents tomorrow.
Mom: All these ideas are not yours.
Eddy: Listen to me. Listen. To the words. I'm saying.
Eddy: Please.
Eddy: I'm telling you.... I've been like this for a long time.
Eddy: When I forget my homework, bomb a quiz....
Eddy: I feel crushed, and then you say I didn't care enough,
Eddy: So I just have to hold it in.
Eddy: I have no one to tell.
Mom: ...You could have told me at any point.
Mom: That's... what family is supposed to be for.
Mom: Family time is time to complain! And have us complain with you.
Mom: We come home and try to let go of our stress from work, school, job by talking to you.
Eddy: ...Two of those are the same thing.
Eddy: ...
Eddy: The frustrating part is, I know you're being sincere.
Eddy: You ask... how I did in school, how my day was.
Eddy: And I know you care.
Eddy: But please just... just listen. Let me talk to you as another person.
Eddy: It's not just the bad things I want to share, too.
Eddy: We... June and I share other things.
Mom: Like what?
Eddy: Shows... we like? Uh, the things we want to do in the future?
Mom: I can't... give any input to your anime, but you should tell me the things that make you happy.
Mom: It's why your old man comes home from work every day. Tired and sore.
Mom: It's... why we come home.
Mom: ...
Mom: What do you want to do in the future?
Eddy: Uh... that, I'm not sure about yet....
Mom: Then what were <i>you</i> two doing? ...Making babies?
Mom: You're too young for that.
<< camerashake Cameras 1 0.1 50 >>
Eddy: Noooo, no no no.
Eddy: ...Okay, maybe that should be a secret.

Ellen: ...
Eddy: ...Did you hear?
Ellen: I don't know how I <i>wouldn't</i> have.
Eddy: What... do you think?
Ellen: You know what?
Ellen: I already told Mom about my new boyfriend.
Eddy: ...You WHAT?
Ellen: She already knew. Or had a suspicion.
Ellen: So I told her. I had to muster up... a lot.
Ellen: I was like, "damn it!"
Ellen: And she told me the usual things. Be careful, is he a doctor, etc.
Eddy: Even though you... hid it from her?
Ellen: Was it a smart idea? I'm not sure either.
Ellen: I do think, though....
Ellen: Sometimes people will listen, if you're willing to talk.
Ellen: Not always, but a conversation happens when two people want to understand each other.
Ellen: And I think she understood how much it hurt me last time.
Eddy: I... hope it works out for you.
Eddy: So wait.
Eddy: Since when do you listen to me?
Ellen: I listen enough to know you're not a virgin any more.
Eddy: ...Alright, that's the end of that.
Ellen: Night.
Eddy: Night.
