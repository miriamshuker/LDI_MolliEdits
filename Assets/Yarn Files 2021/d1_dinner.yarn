Dad: Your mom's too busy.@v
Mom: I don't have time to eat at work.
Eddy: That <i>can't</i> be healthy....@
Eddy: Maybe get something for breakfast? We still got cereal.
Mom: I'm fine! Not even hungry.@v
Ellen: I can pack you lunch, maybe...?
Ellen: Since I wake up around the same time.@
Eddy: Yeah, you have to have a minute or two to scarf <i>something</i> down!

Mom's glaring at me!

Mom: Put your phone away.@v
Mom: Dinner is supposed to be family time.
Mom: And Ellen, who are you texting with that smile on your face?
Ellen: M-Me? Smiling?@
Mom: This is just like when you were with that guy. I'm so glad you got rid of him.
Eddy: We're doing THIS again?
Ellen: Why's this your favorite thing to talk about?
Mom: I have to make sure you remember!@v
Mom: I'm not saying you should move on right away, but don't have any second thoughts.
Mom: You're beautiful, smart, and too kind, like me.
Mom: So one guy is just a drop in the bucket.
Dad: Heh.
Mom: Did you say something?
Dad: Your mom's completely right.
Mom: You invested a lot of time in this relationship, so I know it's not easy to get over.
Dad: But don't feel bad about leaving if you see something you don't like.
Eddy: I mean, that has its pros and cons.@
Eddy: Sometimes it takes some work to build something positive.
Ellen: Yeah, there are things that should've been red flags, but it can be so hard to tell.
Eddy: That's true too.
Mom: Anyway, that guy was no good.@v
Mom: He takes up all your time at home, doesn't respect our family's rules, makes you stay out late, and didn't even always pay when you go out!@
Ellen: (But <i>I</i> want to stay out late....)
Dad: There are plenty of fish in the sea.
Mom: Taller, handsomer, thinner, and smarter fish who have money!
...Hold on, I'm just the skinny fish here!@
Mom: Like your cousin --@v
Mom: She found a lawyer who gave her a CAR for their first anniversary.
Dad: Much better than scraping by with a teacher.
Dad: Being happy is good, but so is having a roof over your head.
Mom: People say to marry who you love, but love doesn't keep your stomach full.
Ellen: Yeah, yeah, I know....@
Eddy: ...
Ellen: ....
Mom: So is your friend still coming over tomorrow, Eddy?@v
Eddy: ....@
Eddy: Uh, yeah. We're still practicing.
Eddy: She'll be here after dinner with her violin.
Mom: Remember she's just here for music.
Eddy: Yeah.

Well....
There's a good reason why June doesn't want my parents to know we're dating.
You can't just <b>be</b>. You have to be better than someone else.

Mom: Eddy, you have work?@v
Mom: If not, wash and dry these beansprouts for me.@
(Should I help? It'll probably take up the rest of my free time before dinner.)
->Help:
    Eddy: Okay.
    Mom: They're in the bottom drawer of the fridge.
    Eddy: And the spinny drying thing is under the sink, right?
    Mom: Yeah.

    Eddy: I'll help clean up after, though!
    Mom: You have to do that anyway.
    Eddy: ...True.
